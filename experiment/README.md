# Mental Rotation Experiment

## Version A

### Design

8 conditions with 90 trials each (plus 10 training trials). Each of
the 20 stimuli is repeated 9 times and each rotation (0-340) is
repeated 10 times (5 same, 5 flipped), giving a block of 180 trials,
which is then split in half.

### Data

Collected data for 16 participants.

### Notes/Issues

* high error rate (9/16 subjects had at least 75% accuracy, 7/16 have
  at least 85% accuracy, and 4/16 have at least 90% accuracy)
* fewer data points for 0-degree and 180-degree rotations, because all
  other rotations have a corresponding angle (e.g. 20 and 340)

## Version B

### Design

8 conditions with 100 trials each (plus 10 training trials). Each of
the 20 stimuli is repeated 10 times and each rotation (0-340, plus
another repetition of 0 and 180) is repeated 10 times (5 same, 5
flipped), giving a block of 200 trials, which is then split in half.
